# Quick Start Guide

**Last updated:** January 15, 2025

This article provides a quick guide to getting started using KoboToolbox. It explains how to create an account, build and deploy a form, and start collecting data.

## Create an Account and Log In

To get started, go to the [sign up page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/sign-up/) and create an account on one of our public servers. Most users sign up for an account on our Global KoboToolbox Server. Users and organizations that require or prefer data hosting in the European Union can sign up for an account on the European Union KoboToolbox Server.

Activate your account using the link sent via email, then log in via the server URL or the [sign up page](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/sign-up/).

## Create Your First Project

To create your first form:

1. Click on **NEW**. You will be asked to choose the source of your project.
2. Choose **Build from scratch** to create a new form using the KoboToolbox Formbuilder.
3. In the **Project Details** dialog, enter relevant information about your project, then click **Create project**.

## Build a Form Using Formbuilder

1. Once in the Formbuilder, click the <i class="k-icon-plus"></i> button to add your first question. Enter the question label and choose a question type.
2. To set question parameters, click on the <i class="k-icon-settings"></i> **Settings** icon. For example, you can make the question required or add skip logic.
3. Click <i class="k-icon-view"></i> **Preview form** to view and test your form.
4. To save the form, click **Save** in the upper right corner, then click <i class="k-icon-close"></i> to close the form.

## Deploy Your Form

1. To start collecting data, click **DEPLOY** on the **FORM** page to deploy your draft form as a new data collection project.
2. Under **Collect data**, click **Copy** to share the form link for data entry from a browser on any device (computer, iPhone, Android).
3. Alternatively, download and set up the KoboCollect Android app for mobile data collection.

Once you collect data, you can view, edit, and download it from the **DATA** page of your project. You can also use the Question Library to save and reuse questions across projects.
