00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Welcome to this tutorial
on creating forms in KoboToolbox.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Today we'll learn how to use
the KoboToolbox Formbuilder.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,000
First, log in to your account
on the Global Server.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Once you're logged in,
click on the NEW button.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
This opens the form creation dialog
where you can start a new project.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You can choose to start from scratch
or use the Question Library.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
The Question Library has templates
for common data collection needs.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
For this tutorial, let's start
with a blank form.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Click on "Build from scratch"
to continue.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Now you're in the Formbuilder interface
where you can add questions.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
To add a question,
click the plus icon here.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You'll see different question types
you can choose from.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Let's add a text question first.
This is the most basic type.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,500
Type your question in the
label field here.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,500
Notice the data column name
is auto-generated.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is important for when you
export your data later.

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Now let's add a select question
for multiple choice options.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Click the plus icon again
and choose Select One.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You need to add choices
for the respondent to select.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
Click on "Add choice" to add
each option one by one.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Each choice needs a label
that people will see.

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,500
And a value that will be stored
in your data column.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
For location-based data,
you can use cascading selects.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
This filters choices based on
previous answers.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For example, select country,
then city within that country.

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,500
To set this up, you need to create
your list_name in the choices sheet.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We'll cover cascading selects
in detail in another video.

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's add one more important
question type.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
The GPS question automatically
collects location data.

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
This is very useful for field surveys
in humanitarian work.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Click the plus icon and
select "geopoint" from the list.

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
When someone fills out your form,
this captures their coordinates.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now that we've added some questions,
let's save our work.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000
Click the SAVE button
at the top right.

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Your form is now saved as a Draft
in your project list.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
When you're ready to use it,
you need to deploy.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,500
Click the DEPLOY button
to make it active.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can then collect data using
KoboCollect on Android.

39
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
Or share the web form link
for online data collection.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
To view your collected data,
go to the DATA tab.

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Here you can see submissions
in table or map view.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can export your data
in various formats like Excel.

43
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
That's the basics of creating
a form in KoboToolbox!

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000

data collecting!
