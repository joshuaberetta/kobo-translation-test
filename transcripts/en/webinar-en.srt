*Music*

2
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,762  
Welcome everyone to Kobo's milestone webinar celebrating our ten years of community-led impact and innovation.

3
00:00:15,762 --> 00:00:22,762  
Over the last ten years, you have taken our tools to the field and helped us create something better year over year.

4
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:27,742  
Together, we have built an amazing community that spans over two hundred countries.

5
00:00:27,742 --> 00:00:33,629  
And today, we celebrate this community and everybody here who's curious about our work.

6
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:38,149  
I'm Dev More. I'll be your host for today. So, here's our agenda for today.

7
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,309  
We'll first start with our ten year journey, and Patrick will share about this journey.

8
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,579  
And then, we'll have Tino who will tell us about some

9
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,569  
recent product updates and about the future of the platform.

10
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:57,319  
Then we'll jump into talking about our new offerings, where I'll be talking to Ayman and Paula.

11
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:01,229  
After that, we have Tala from WHH and Sharon

12
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,059  
from Save the Children who will be sharing their experience with the platform.

13
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:09,559  
And in the end, we'll have an open round of Q\&A where we will

14
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:13,487  
take up some questions from the Q\&A box.

15
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:19,407  
So, let's start where it all began with Patrick, our cofounder and president.

16
00:01:19,407 --> 00:01:24,147  
Patrick, could you share a bit about the history of Kobo from its earliest days and the

17
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:28,739  
journey on how we got to where we are today? Sure.

18
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:35,069  
First, let me thank you, Dev, and everyone on the team for organizing this event, and thanks to the participants.

19
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:38,430  
It's amazing to see so many people coming and joining

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,239  
us in discussing where we were and where we're going.

21
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,470  
So I really look forward to the discussion today.

22
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,560  
But as you said, let's maybe look a little bit back before we look forward.

23
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,169  
And not many people know that Kobo is actually more than ten years old.

24
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:58,440  
It really started as an idea when

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,079  
Phuong Pham, the other cofounder (but also my wife), and I were in Iraq.

26
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,839  
\[Unintelligible\]

27
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:12,245  
\[Unintelligible\]

28
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:17,955  
And we had a very simple idea. It seems so obvious today, but it wasn't the case at the time, was, well, let's ask people.

29
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:23,804  
And so we started using what would be traditionally epidemiological methods to kind of assess

30
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:30,474  
people's opinions and perspectives on how to rebuild after violence.

31
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:36,254  
But in doing so, we realized that we needed to move much faster in order to be able to drive action.

32
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:42,204  
In other words, the time from the moment we collect data to inform policies is very, very short.

33
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:47,194  
And so we needed to go faster and that's how we created Kobo. And so moving forward with, you

34
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:50,414  
know, a couple of years, we use literally the money we would normally use

35
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:53,884  
for photocopies and data entry to create the first Kobo.

36
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:56,944  
And I had a bit of a kick looking back at some of those pictures

37
00:02:56,944 --> 00:03:00,345  
because what you see there on the top right is the very first Kobo.

38
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:05,024  
It's not Android. It's not iPhone. Those things did not exist. It's actually a Mio phone that

39
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:08,072  
was running a Windows mobile application.

40
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:13,645  
That is the very first version of Kobo. But what we learned from it is that it worked, that it

41
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:17,774  
was really possible to collect data in the field

42
00:03:17,774 --> 00:03:22,857  
in a way that would allow us to move faster.

43
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:27,057  
And that experience of Kobo in the field is what gave the name Kobo.

44
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:33,187  
Kobo literally means transfer. It was really about transferring knowledge from the experience

45
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:38,157  
of people to those who are taking action and building projects.

46
00:03:38,157 --> 00:03:41,807  
And so the next step forward was in the Central African Republic.

47
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,857  
what you see on the right is “hotel Kobo”.

48
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:51,559  
It's literally a hut in which you what you see there were those solar chargers and how we would be

49
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:56,059  
in the field without connectivity, without any kind of access

50
00:03:56,059 --> 00:04:00,649  
to electricity even, and still being able to collect data.

51
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:04,480  
And that's where we realized \- Hey. We're onto something here. This is actually helpful.

52
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,559  
And we started having people asking us, “can we use it?”

53
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:11,240  
And so that's what really led us to where Kobo

54
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,225  
kind of started building.

55
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:18,725  
It proved that it works in the worst conditions.

56
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:24,229  
So then how did we build from there? And so we deployed in DRC, Uganda, Liberia.

57
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:29,420  
And as people started using the tool, we made it publicly available, open source.

58
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,009  
We just wanted it to be a global good. And then IRC, OCHA approached us in a partnership.

59
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:40,739  
How can we make it better? How can we make it more relevant for humanitarian actors and

60
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:44,234  
others in the field facing the same kind of challenge you're

61
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:48,959  
facing and and for which this tool could be really useful.

62
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,399  
And that's where over the course of one year, we worked on basically releasing

63
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:02,329  
the first global platform as it looks today, leveraging open standards, access forms

64
00:05:02,329 --> 00:05:06,345  
with this partnership with OCHA and IRC,

65
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:10,442  
making it publicly available worldwide through our public server.

66
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,512  
And that's very much the starting point of the modern Kobo, if you’d like.

67
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:18,762  
So that's the ten years we're talking about. And something amazing happened from that point

68
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:24,574  
in time, which is that it took about a year to get the first million submissions. It took

69
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,804  
another year to get five million submissions, another year to get

70
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:31,514  
twenty million submissions, and now we've reached a billion submissions.

71
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:38,214  
And the point is that we have grown alongside organizations like yours in both

72
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:41,914  
understanding how to improve the tools and making it relevant

73
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:45,640  
and useful for actors on the ground.

74
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:51,570  
So, in 2019, what was up until then a project run by Phuong and I out of our

75
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:57,869  
universities and across time and different places, we actually established a

76
00:05:57,869 --> 00:06:00,940  
nonprofit, Kobo, which is now hosting Kobo-

77
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,950  
Toolbox and making sure that this original vision remains intact.

78
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:11,660  
The vision around making sure that we provide the best, most accessible,

79
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:18,190  
freely usable tool for organizations who need data to drive impact.

80
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,110  
We're very proud that we've been recognized as a digital public good, even prouder to see the

81
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:29,630  
number of people in this webinar, even prouder to see the statistics coming on the usage in the field.

82
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,390  
And so, again, it's been an amazing journey driven by you.

83
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,612  
I mentioned the one billion submissions. Dev mentioned the fact that we pretty much operate

84
00:06:39,612 --> 00:06:43,572  
or have users or people leveraging Kobo to

85
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:47,727  
advance their impact around the world in every country.

86
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:51,717  
And as you can see, the statistics are clear. They speak for themselves.

87
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:58,175  
Yes. We have some users, very large users, who help us maintain and ensure that we can

88
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:03,864  
continue offering the platform for free to the large majority of our users, whether community

89
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:10,659  
based organizations, small local NGOs organizations for whom frankly,

90
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:14,179  
KoboToolbox is the best possible solution in

91
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:18,454  
in order to drive impact again.

92
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:21,864  
So it's not just a gimmick to say that you named us.

93
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:26,854  
It is truly the community. It is truly the experience, the partners in Uganda that gave us the

94
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:30,264  
name, and it is truly through the partnership over the

95
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:34,344  
years that we have been shaped into the platform we are today.

96
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:38,204  
The functions, the needs, the way to operate Kobo \-

97
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:42,664  
was all driven by users, for users, with users.

98
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:46,064  
And you continue to inspire us in that journey.

99
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:50,874  
And that remains very much core to what we will discuss next, which is what are some of the

100
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:54,844  
priorities, what are some of the directions in which we are going.

101
00:07:54,844 --> 00:08:01,020  
This is a critical moment because what we know is that those systems, those information

102
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,310  
landscapes on which we rely on are actually disappearing.

103
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:09,492  
They are definitely under threat. And at the same time, the reality of the funding landscape

104
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:16,505  
and the growing needs and the complexity is that in some ways, data is even more critical than ever.

105
00:08:16,505 --> 00:08:19,945  
The fewer resources we have, the better we need to be at

106
00:08:19,945 --> 00:08:24,565  
allocating them, and data has an important role to play in that function.

107
00:08:24,565 --> 00:08:30,225  
And so we want to be your partner in making sure that we are not building top down information

108
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:34,135  
system, but really leveraging the community and more participatory

109
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:38,854  
information system in the humanitarian space.

110
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:43,905  
In other words, what we wanna make sure is that we are contributing towards this ability

111
00:08:43,905 --> 00:08:49,724  
to create the change from a community perspective that you as actors on the ground have the

112
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:54,140  
agency and power to create that change.

113
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,840  
So, I hope that you will join us and there are different ways of doing that.

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,319  
You know, the forum is an important part where you can help first time users,

115
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:08,069  
and we really appreciate all of you who are contributing already to that forum.

116
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:14,030  
You can share your lessons learned. It's amazing. I mean, we have learned from practice and so we want to learn from you.

117
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:20,460  
And so any ideas you have on new features, on improvements, on the way to operate, we're very keen to hear that.

118
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,290  
Again, we want to hear from you. We want to listen to your experience and opinions, and you

119
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,450  
should feel free to reach out to us with suggestions, improvements, and sharing your experience.

120
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:38,350  
We're very, very keen to do that. I will repeat it again: “for users, with users”, is to me

121
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,860  
critical. And “by users” because we continue doing research, doing data collection and

122
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,320  
partnering with organizations like you in the field.

123
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,130  
I'm very proud that a few years ago, we started rolling out the ambassador program, which is

124
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:56,890  
really a way to recognize those contributors on the ground who are already helping each

125
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,170  
other and kind of empowering those actors in their

126
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,895  
reach and their support to KoboToolbox users.

127
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:10,885  
And finally, I need to, of course, note the Enterprise partner that can join a

128
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:14,025  
community of practice that is dedicated to large-scale

129
00:10:14,025 --> 00:10:17,455  
organizations with a wide deployment of the KoboToolbox platform.

130
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:22,385  
They have unique needs and we want to recognize that and really kind of make sure that we spend

131
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:26,415  
the support and engagement from our smallest, very local

132
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:31,145  
partners all the way to our largest key users.

133
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:34,765  
Again, I want to emphasize that this is critical to the future of Kobo.

134
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:40,075  
We have exciting news. We're working on AI. We're working on so many features that

135
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:43,495  
Tino and others will outline in the future.

136
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:47,745  
But it is with you in mind. It is with your input, with your partnership, and with you

137
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:50,905  
driving those efforts through those avenues.

138
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:54,505  
And so I hope that you continue being part of our future.

139
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:58,280  
Over to you, Dev.

140
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,577  
Awesome. Thank you so much, Patrick. Thank you for telling our story and providing

141
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:09,524  
such a powerful vision for the future that we want to create with our wonderful community.

142
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:14,044  
Before we let you go, I had a quick question for you.

143
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:20,460  
What is your favorite memory as you have navigated the past twenty years at Kobo?

144
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,980  
I was about to go, and I have to apologize.

145
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:31,424  
I will jump on a separate call, but I'll still be in the Q\&A. It's a tough question.

146
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:36,034  
There are so many from really the creation and the rollout of Kobo.

147
00:11:36,034 --> 00:11:42,154  
But I would say that I'm still very active on the ground. And when I go to small

148
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:48,359  
areas in Northern Iraq or in Ethiopia, and people don't really know or associate me with

149
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:52,479  
Kobo (I've never been promotional in that sense),

150
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,549  
They come to me and say, hey. “You know, we're using this great tool.

151
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:59,399  
It's called KoboToolbox. Do you know about it?” Well, Actually, I do know about it.

152
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,489  
And and it's an amazing experience to see how

153
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:06,579  
wide the reach has been and how helpful the tool has been.

154
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:10,659  
Something that frankly was created because we needed it, because we wanted to be able to do

155
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:14,617  
that kind of engagement, to see that kind of need and

156
00:12:14,617 --> 00:12:18,637  
service echo with so many people around the world has been amazing.

157
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:22,347  
So, again, thank you everyone for making Kobo the success it is today.

158
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:26,945  
Thank you, Patrick.

159
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:30,304  
So, before we continue and go to the next section, we'll run a quick

160
00:12:30,304 --> 00:12:33,945  
thirty-second poll, which should appear on your screen.

161
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:38,424  
When was your first time using KoboToolbox?

162
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:45,419  
I know for me, it was 2017 when somebody

163
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:50,700  
from IRC insisted that I check out KoboToolbox's report builder for its

164
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,479  
intuitiveness.

165
00:13:01,184 --> 00:13:05,294  
I wish you could see what I see, which is the numbers coming in in real time.

166
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:08,792  
It's fantastic. Hundreds of responses already.

167
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:12,700  
Oh, wow\! Tino: We are over 50%.

168
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,119  
Alright. If you haven't voted yet, please quickly add your vote to the poll.

169
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:21,660  
I realize as a panelist, I cannot vote, but I will select

170
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,300  
before 2014, and I would be curious to know if anyone has done that.

171
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:29,500  
That would be amazing because that would be the very early days of Kobo.

172
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:36,310  
You will be surprised. Okay. I'm gonna end it. Here are the results.

173
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:43,150  
Alright. Well, it seems to be 2018-2019

174
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:49,392  
to be the winner here.

175
00:13:49,392 --> 00:13:52,462  
No. Actually, the year before that, 2020-2021.

176
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:59,384  
Great. Great to see a mix of long time users and newcomers. So, yeah,

177
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:01,625  
let's move to the next section

178
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,540  
All right. I would like to welcome

179
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,887  
Tino, our chief operating and innovation officer.

180
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:24,465  
Tino has been guiding our product

181
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:28,275  
roadmap and the Kobo team for many years now.

182
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:34,462  
He will share with us some exciting updates and give us a glimpse into the future of the platform.

183
00:14:34,462 --> 00:14:37,889  
Over to you, Tino. Tino: Thank you, Dev.

184
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,809  
Thanks, Patrick. And thanks for everyone for being here today. It's really fantastic to have

185
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:44,939  
such a huge group from the Kobo community.

186
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:49,929  
You know, the last ten years of growth and innovation behind KoboToolbox have been extremely exciting for all of us.

187
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:55,219  
And as you can see, it's not just the organization that's been growing, but of course also our users.

188
00:14:55,219 --> 00:15:00,057  
We now have more than a quarter million active users and that's very humbling.

189
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,447  
You know, we're reaching this pivotal moment, not just because of where we've been growing as

190
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:07,497  
an organization, but also because of the features that are still coming up.

191
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:12,197  
But first, I wanna take a moment to discuss some of the new and most recent updates that

192
00:15:12,197 --> 00:15:17,297  
you can now draw on and that expands the way that you can use Kobo to collect and analyze data.

193
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:21,337  
Here you already see one of them. That's been one of our most anticipated feature updates

194
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,407  
from the last year, especially for larger organizations.

195
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:29,612  
Our Teams feature in essence allows well, teams and, of course, larger organizations to

196
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:33,642  
manage larger groups of people that are part of their team.

197
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,772  
So, you can invite colleagues, manage team members, and centralize data management this way.

198
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:42,335  
And, of course, if someone leaves a team, you can remove them and thereby remove access.

199
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:47,315  
Joining a team works this way. You actually transfer the user's existing projects,

200
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:51,595  
which are then owned by the team, and any new projects, any new forms or data collection

201
00:15:51,595 --> 00:15:57,095  
projects that they create in the future will then be owned by the team itself rather than an individual user.

202
00:15:57,095 --> 00:16:01,825  
And that's extremely helpful so that if someone leaves the team, the owners and admins of the

203
00:16:01,825 --> 00:16:05,145  
team will always have full visibility and access and control over the data

204
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:08,500  
that was collected on behalf of the organization.

205
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:14,924  
For now, the teams feature is available through our teams and enterprise plan and, of course, through our private server offerings.

206
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:19,375  
This also means, and that's really useful for many larger teams, that you have a shared

207
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,234  
amount of submission and storage usage that the entire team can

208
00:16:23,234 --> 00:16:27,484  
access, so instead of having individual buckets.

209
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:34,379  
And I know Ayman will talk about this a bit later today. Next, we

210
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:39,792  
recently rolled out our automatic transcription and translation features to all of our users.

211
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:43,242  
What that means is you can now turn your interview audio responses.

212
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:48,722  
And, of course, audio is extremely useful for collecting open-ended responses from your surveys.

213
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:52,832  
You can transcribe them into text in many different languages. And then if needed, you can

214
00:16:52,832 --> 00:16:58,549  
also translate that transcript into more than a hundred fifty languages using machine translation.

215
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:02,729  
Obviously, manual transcription and manual translation are always options.

216
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:09,000  
And, of course, you can use our editor feature to review and edit any of the transcripts or translations as needed.

217
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,690  
That's extremely important because, of course, AI tools, as any other technology, can make mistakes.

218
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:19,940  
So we always encourage you, and as you can see here, we sort of force you to review before

219
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:26,869  
saving the transcript. Next, we built a feature to make it possible not just to

220
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:33,329  
transcribe the audio, but also to do qualitative analysis.

221
00:17:33,329 --> 00:17:37,382  
You can go to the next slide. We made it possible to

222
00:17:37,382 --> 00:17:41,722  
analyze the data that you collect this way much more effectively.

223
00:17:41,722 --> 00:17:44,952  
So, we rolled out the quality of analysis feature a few months ago.

224
00:17:44,952 --> 00:17:49,072  
And what you can do with that is actually create additional meta questions about these open

225
00:17:49,072 --> 00:17:52,612  
ended interview transcripts, and then you can assign labels, categorize them,

226
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:56,332  
summarize them, and whatever you need as a summary.

227
00:17:56,332 --> 00:18:01,732  
That feature in particular makes it much, much easier to conduct truly mixed method surveys.

228
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:07,152  
This means you can combine the advantages of fast mobile electronic data collection with the

229
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,322  
depth and rigor of qualitative data as well.

230
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:14,932  
For example, you can easily add one or more audio questions to your existing survey just to be

231
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:18,602  
able to record the why to a question, or can you give me an

232
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:22,362  
example or give me an anecdote for that sort of data.

233
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:26,122  
So, you can combine your close-ended, fast,

234
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:30,392  
multiple choice questions with this open-ended data much more easily.

235
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:36,762  
It also means you can do this without having to leave Kobo. You don't need expensive and difficult software to do qualitative analysis.

236
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:40,252  
And after you've collected and analyzed it this way, what you see in the interface here, it

237
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:44,232  
still goes part it becomes part of the same data table.

238
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:48,052  
Your exports, your API \- everything already includes these responses.

239
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:52,522  
So all you need to do is download and visualize it and analyze it together with the rest

240
00:18:52,522 --> 00:19:00,874  
of your dataset. Next, we also, a few months ago, added logging and security features.

241
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,875  
Actually, quite a few of them. And we're really happy to do that, and we're

242
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,064  
really proud that we've collaborated with you and UNHCR on this.

243
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:13,885  
What it allows us to do is actually provide you the logs of when someone logged into your account.

244
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:17,574  
If that was someone else other than you, maybe you've given access to someone on your team.

245
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,895  
You can see exactly when they logged in and from where. For project history, you can also see

246
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:26,265  
exactly when someone made a change and, when data came in, when the modifications were

247
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,824  
made to the data, to the form, to the metadata of the project.

248
00:19:29,824 --> 00:19:34,424  
All of that is extremely useful, especially if you have a large, distributed team.

249
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,875  
If you work in a lot of different locations, you wanna know who made what edit.

250
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:42,635  
And so you can see all that. You can download it. You can export it for lots of compliance and

251
00:19:42,635 --> 00:19:45,930  
auditing purposes.

252
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,479  
That is extremely useful. And then finally, we're excited today that Kobo

253
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:53,829  
will officially be ISO 27001 certified.

254
00:19:53,829 --> 00:20:00,234  
That's extremely important for lots of organizations where this is a compliance requirement.

255
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:05,847  
And what it means is for those who haven't heard of the standard, it basically certifies

256
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:10,527  
and ensures that Kobo always follows the highest international standards for data security to

257
00:20:10,527 --> 00:20:14,269  
protect all private data: all

258
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:18,279  
data that you collect through your surveys, and of course, your own personal data as well.

259
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,889  
So, these are all the features we're most proud of from the past few months, and I think

260
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:26,704  
they will make a big difference to our many users and organizations around the world.

261
00:20:26,704 --> 00:20:30,804  
But I'm even more excited to show you what we're planning for the near future.

262
00:20:30,804 --> 00:20:34,304  
For starters, the coming months will see us release

263
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:37,824  
an AI analysis feature as you can see here on the screen already.

264
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:42,064  
That particular feature will allow you to answer these meta questions we saw earlier about

265
00:20:42,064 --> 00:20:48,125  
open ended audio transcripts in a much more efficient and time saving way.

266
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:51,794  
It also means, in our experience, it is more reliable than asking

267
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:55,734  
many data analysts, human analysts, on your team to do this on your behalf.

268
00:20:55,734 --> 00:21:00,025  
Our new AI models that we're training for this purpose will automatically analyze the transcript

269
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:03,164  
and answer all the relevant questions within seconds.

270
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:09,099  
So we're building this integration with the highest ethical standards and in consultation with many of our partners and users.

271
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:13,309  
We always, of course, design this feature to make sure that there's a human in the loop.

272
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,299  
So as you can see, there's a button, for example, to verify the data.

273
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:21,775  
And if it's not verified, you know that it came from an AI agent only.

274
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:26,505  
That particular feature will really speed up the process. For example, you could now collect

275
00:21:26,505 --> 00:21:32,360  
hundreds or thousands of audio from open ended responses and then analyze them in a

276
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,820  
single day or in a single morning perhaps rather than giving this to lots of

277
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:43,714  
people to transcribe and analyze over the course of days or more likely weeks. Next,

278
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:50,024  
our huge flagship initiative that we're working on designing right now is our AI powered form builder.

279
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:55,354  
This actually will integrate an AI assistant for the first time, and that'll help you

280
00:21:55,354 --> 00:21:58,534  
give feedback, receive feedback to your form.

281
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:02,204  
So while you're designing the drafts, you can get immediate feedback.

282
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:06,334  
You can also use it to create survey questions based on your prompts.

283
00:22:06,334 --> 00:22:11,625  
And, of course, very importantly, we're adding a way to upload any existing indicators or

284
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:16,114  
guidance materials that you might have within your organization or within your sector.

285
00:22:16,114 --> 00:22:21,734  
So imagine having a survey expert, a methods specialist always at your fingertips,

286
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:25,924  
always at the ready to give you feedback, to tell you what the best way is to ask a particular

287
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:32,074  
question, who might tell you to improve perhaps your consent question, and so on.

288
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:36,474  
So we're training this AI agent. We're still in the early stages, but we're training that to

289
00:22:36,474 --> 00:22:43,135  
be very, very careful, not just to be as ethical and reliable as

290
00:22:43,135 --> 00:22:49,035  
possible, but also to use the right methodological guidance and training available within our sector.

291
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:53,484  
And as a result, once this is available, I think it'll make a huge difference to our sectors

292
00:22:53,484 --> 00:23:00,459  
and to the nonprofit world to build better surveys much faster. And then finally, we're

293
00:23:00,459 --> 00:23:04,280  
working on incorporating more case management features in Kobo.

294
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,670  
Our goal is to enable you to track beneficiaries over time and make longitudinal studies much easier to manage.

295
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,349  
We've listened to many users who told us that it's extremely important

296
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:18,180  
to them that Kobo remains easy, intuitive to use.

297
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,959  
And so we're very careful about adding these quite advanced features to make sure it doesn't

298
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,760  
clutter up the interface and doesn't make it hard to use in practice.

299
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,170  
So if you're interested in joining our user research on this feature, we'd love to hear from you.

300
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:33,790  
Please, let us know. There will be a survey at the very end of the webinar.

301
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,369  
You can add your details there and check a box. So, we'd love to have

302
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:41,232  
you and talk to your team about this more.

303
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:44,592  
Alright. So before I hand it back over to Dev, we have lots planned for today.

304
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:50,222  
I have a final appeal. KoboToolbox has always been, as you heard from Patrick, community-led.

305
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:55,512  
We really depend on you guys. So, if you have any other ideas for new features, big or small,

306
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:59,422  
improvements. I see some of them already coming in here today.

307
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:02,882  
But really where we want to hear from you is on the Community Forum.

308
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:07,942  
The Community Forum is built for you to share ideas, to vote on ideas from other users.

309
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:13,022  
So, please, if you haven't already, do sign up to go to community.kobotoolbox.org,

310
00:24:13,022 --> 00:24:17,025  
create an account, and share what you have in mind.

311
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:21,254  
And of course, interact with others who already have posted ideas.

312
00:24:21,254 --> 00:24:25,285  
You can vote on them and so on. Of course, the forum is also great, as you heard from Patrick,

313
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:29,145  
for helping each other out, learning from each other, and

314
00:24:29,145 --> 00:24:33,374  
doing that also makes a huge difference to our many, many thousands of users.

315
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:37,482  
So thank you to those who are here today who are already very active.

316
00:24:37,482 --> 00:24:42,692  
Our ambassadors and our community power users, we really love you guys.

317
00:24:42,692 --> 00:24:49,175  
So thank you for being a part of this Kobo community over the last few years  And, yeah, back to you, Dev.

318
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:53,049  
Thank you. Thank you, Tino. And thank you for all the

319
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:57,380  
work that has gone into making the platform what it is today.

320
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,079  
I know a lot of community members will be really happy,

321
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,929  
to hear what they heard today about upcoming capabilities.

322
00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:09,640  
And I know that our product team is really excited to work with the with our community

323
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,854  
as we build these capabilities out.

324
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:17,224  
Before we move on to the next section, I had a question for you.

325
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:21,405  
This comes up often, and I also

326
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:25,959  
see a couple of questions in this direction.

327
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:29,250  
So, thought of asking you while you're here.

328
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:35,554  
You know, so as you know, the platform is known for its accessibility, for its

329
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:38,704  
simplicity, and for its intuitiveness.

330
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:45,274  
As we work on integrating AI, how do you think that'll impact how

331
00:25:45,274 --> 00:25:51,150  
people collect data on the ground. Tino: That's a great question, Dev.

332
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,160  
Yeah. And quickly, I think one of the most important things

333
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,320  
for us and for many people here today is Kobo is a free platform.

334
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:02,129  
It's not only open source, but we want to make sure that it is remaining a free platform as a nonprofit.

335
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:07,760  
Our mission is to help many of you. So the most important thing is that we focus on our core offering:

336
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,474  
Collecting data in the most widely-accessible way possible within

337
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:18,117  
limits, of course, that's something we will never change.

338
00:26:18,117 --> 00:26:22,160  
All these new AI features, of course, they're extra.

339
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,400  
They're additional things that we're experimenting with. And so, yes, they can make the

340
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,940  
survey creation a bit faster and perhaps better in some cases.

341
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,430  
They can make the analysis faster. And so they are added services, and we're experimenting

342
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:41,579  
even with other ways to help you use AI for conducting questions and so on.

343
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:46,520  
But at the end of the day, our roots are very clear, and they show us that nothing will

344
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,539  
replace a human interviewer who can do face to face interviews.

345
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:55,419  
Um , what we can do is make a lot of the other processes a little bit easier, a little bit faster, and more efficient.

346
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:59,889  
And whether that's AI or just other software,  improvements, we we will always see where

347
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:05,194  
we can focus our energy  Well, good to know.

348
00:27:05,194 --> 00:27:09,944  
Alright. So,  before we move to the next section, we'll have another poll.

349
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:16,525  
 And this is which feature update you're

350
00:27:16,525 --> 00:27:19,525  
more most excited to hear about.

351
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:32,025  
Well, not surprising  AI is getting a lot of

352
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:36,895  
traction. I mean, for me, it's definitely offline case management.

353
00:27:36,895 --> 00:27:43,085  
I think our sector deserves a case management capability that is

354
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:46,447  
both easy and intuitive to configure

355
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,454  
Alright.

356
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:07,524  
Do we have the results? And here they are.

357
00:28:07,524 --> 00:28:10,529  
Thanks everyone for voting.  Alright.

358
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:14,530  
Not surprising. AI-enabled qualitative analysis

359
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:20,660  
comes to the top, closely followed by automatic transcriptions.

360
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:26,515  
Awesome. Thank you everyone for participating. There'll be one more poll in a bit.

361
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:29,684  
Now let's move to the next section.

362
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,909  
Alright.

363
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:46,169  
So, in this section, we'll be talking to Ayman, who leads our partnership efforts, and

364
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:50,449  
Paula, who's a project manager in our Partner Services team.

365
00:28:50,449 --> 00:28:57,295  
They'll be talking to us about our latest and greatest offerings.

366
00:28:57,295 --> 00:29:00,364  
Ayman will talk to us about Teams and Enterprise,

367
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:04,875  
and Paula will talk to us about partner services.

368
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:08,895  
So, you may have noticed in the recent past, there have been quite a few updates to the website.

369
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:13,119  
We've been working hard to gather feedback and align

370
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,810  
our plans and our services to the diverse needs of our community.

371
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:24,345  
So all these updates have been a result of  all that work. Now I would love to

372
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:30,915  
welcome Ayman,  who'll chat with us about the team's plan.

373
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:37,890  
Hey, Ayman. Ayman: Hey, Dev. Dev: Ayman, would love to get your thoughts on

374
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:44,040  
how the new Teams plan came about. Ayman: Thanks, Dev.

375
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:50,450  
As you mentioned, our community and professional plan are primarily for individual users.

376
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,600  
So, with the professional plan providing large data collection efforts, there has been a

377
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,424  
natural evolution in this community just to work more collaboratively, and we responded to that

378
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:07,280  
with the team's offering because multiple users wanted to benefit from a single subscription

379
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,790  
plan, which works well for organizations.

380
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:15,530  
All the projects and data would be owned at the team level.

381
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:21,439  
So, basically, if an individual member leaves, their work is still accessible to the team.

382
00:30:21,439 --> 00:30:26,290  
Of course, it comes with higher submission quota, six hundred thousand submissions per year,

383
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:32,890  
and unlimited storage, which can be shared with the entire team

384
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:39,810  
Awesome  Here, you mentioned a higher submission quota.

385
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:45,430  
Could you share a little bit what exactly those numbers look like?

386
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:51,094  
And after that, I'm very curious to also get your thoughts on if partners are

387
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:54,734  
interested in operating in in many teams,

388
00:30:54,734 --> 00:30:59,430  
how should they be looking at our offerings? Yeah.

389
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:04,859  
We're gonna start with the submission quotas. Basically,  if you subscribe to a Teams plan

390
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:08,239  
on an annual basis, you get six hundred thousand submissions to be

391
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:12,439  
used anytime during the year by all of the plan members.

392
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:16,469  
So, basically, there is no assigned quota to a single account.

393
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:23,255  
It's assigned to the entire team. As for using across multiple teams, I

394
00:31:23,255 --> 00:31:30,190  
Think \- the Teams plan subscription comes with one team, and this

395
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,959  
one team comes with the ability to add additional teams to the original.

396
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:41,060  
As you add more teams, you're really moving in the direction of the organizational use of the platform.

397
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,420  
So, at that point, the enterprise offering might just make more sense and become a good fit

398
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,885  
Then, that's a great segue

399
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:55,765  
into chatting about our two different enterprise offerings.

400
00:31:55,765 --> 00:31:59,475  
Ayman, I would love for you to

401
00:31:59,475 --> 00:32:03,410  
compare these two offerings  Ayman: Sure.

402
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:10,012  
We have basically two enterprise offerings as you mentioned.

403
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,542  
The first is the entry level enterprise offering.

404
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:19,765  
It comes with ten teams plans, basically built into the offering itself, and there is no

405
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:26,440  
limits on submissions or storage for all team members of the organization.

406
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,359  
And then we have the enterprise private server, which gives our partners their own dedicated KoboToolbox server.

407
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:39,179  
And it can be hosted in twenty five countries or even in your own local infrastructure.

408
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:42,405  
Gotcha.

409
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:47,945  
Just so I under under understand this correctly,  when you mentioned

410
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:54,009  
25 countries and local infrastructure, let's say a large organization

411
00:32:54,009 --> 00:33:00,509  
like CRS or IRC or Mercy Corps want multiple

412
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:07,145  
private servers, let's say one in India, one in South Africa.

413
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:10,515  
Could we make it happen?

414
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:14,214  
Absolutely. Yes. As I said, we have hosting in about

415
00:33:14,214 --> 00:33:18,535  
25 countries, and we have some hosting options in our cloud.

416
00:33:18,535 --> 00:33:21,665  
And there we can do it on your own infrastructure.

417
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:28,020  
So, basically, yeah, we can set organizations up this way. Dev: Awesome.

418
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,675  
Thank you. and then could you also tell us a little bit about all the different

419
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:38,914  
types of services that our enterprise partners get? Ayman:  Yeah.

420
00:33:38,914 --> 00:33:44,060  
Basically, the enterprise offerings \- they're not just the software to us.

421
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:49,989  
Fundamentally, they represent a strategic partnership between us and the enterprise partner.

422
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:53,650  
We collaborate closely towards their success.

423
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:59,535  
So our enterprise partners have access to a dedicated customer success manager.

424
00:33:59,535 --> 00:34:05,614  
We provide thirty hours of time set aside for trainings and consultation.

425
00:34:05,614 --> 00:34:11,625  
They get unlimited access to the KoboToolbox Academy for any needs of onboarding or, you

426
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:15,864  
know, getting new staff to work on KoboToolbox.

427
00:34:15,864 --> 00:34:20,125  
And it also comes with priority support within one business day

428
00:34:20,125 --> 00:34:25,149  
 And that's just part of the features.

429
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:29,235  
There's more. Dev:  Great.

430
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:33,985  
Thank you so much,  Ayman, for chatting with us. And also thank you to

431
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:40,015  
entire purchase partnerships team for doing such a great job at

432
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:43,105  
taking care of our partners and making sure that our

433
00:34:43,105 --> 00:34:46,575  
offerings are aligned with the diverse needs of our community.

434
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:49,599  
Thank you. You're welcome.

435
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,859  
Now, I would love to have Paula over to chat about our Partner Services offerings.

436
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:02,584  
Hi, Paula. Hi, Dev. Hi, everyone. Dev: Paula, you have such a

437
00:35:02,584 --> 00:35:08,135  
rich and fascinating background in monitoring and evaluation across multiple countries.

438
00:35:08,135 --> 00:35:11,454  
I'm curious what made you

439
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:15,399  
join Kobo's partner services team.

440
00:35:15,399 --> 00:35:21,860  
Yeah. So I worked with Kobo for years as well, and I saw that many organizations around the

441
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,530  
world are not using Kobo at its maximum potential.

442
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:31,479  
It's very often seen that we're using very basic service, very basic data analysis, and

443
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:37,689  
these team missions is actually work on supporting and getting the best of Kobo

444
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:40,999  
Gotcha.

445
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:47,940  
Thank you. Could you share a little bit about how specifically Partner

446
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,852  
Services help in some of these challenges that our partners face that you were referring to?

447
00:35:54,852 --> 00:36:01,204  
Yeah. So, working with directly with the organizations that are working directly with

448
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:07,954  
communities that need specific features or specific forms for helping them

449
00:36:07,954 --> 00:36:11,774  
understand how to better use Kobo and how to

450
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:16,329  
improve what they are doing, being more efficient in derisking failure.

451
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:21,100  
In our team, we have M\&E practitioners. We have humanitarian workers.

452
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:28,025  
We have people that have worked directly within the field, so we have the perfect combination within teams that are working

453
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:33,634  
directly with Kobo, that have the expertise with Kobo, but also have been working

454
00:36:33,634 --> 00:36:38,740  
directly with communities in the past. Thank you.

455
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,820  
Could you also share

456
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:47,720  
the different types of services offered by our partner services team?

457
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:54,410  
Yeah. Absolutely. So, as Tino and Patrick have mentioned, our aim is also to keep

458
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:57,930  
Kobo being affordable and also

459
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:02,160  
having in the core that we're a nonprofit, and that's the heart of what we do.

460
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,030  
We are also offering some services for big users and for partners.

461
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,219  
We have four basic umbrellas. The first one is form development.

462
00:37:12,219 --> 00:37:17,469  
So, we support teams with the creation of surveys and, in general, the usage of

463
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:20,847  
KoboToolbox, then developing custom dashboards,

464
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:25,015  
research and evaluation, and also solutions that are tailored.

465
00:37:25,015 --> 00:37:28,485  
All of these services are tailored to the needs of specific

466
00:37:28,485 --> 00:37:32,094  
partners. Dev: Great.

467
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:38,882  
Thank you. I'm sure our community would love to hear about a recent example

468
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:42,510  
of a partner services project.  Yeah.

469
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,370  
So we're working with the UN Women Regional Office

470
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:50,610  
In the Arab states with this project that we call TrackIt.

471
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:56,714  
So, what we're doing is, basically, they are working along the region with over ten countries,

472
00:37:56,714 --> 00:38:00,234  
over a hundred implementing partners, and they have

473
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:04,054  
more than eight projects that have been tracked using the system.

474
00:38:04,054 --> 00:38:10,194  
So, we help them create the forms. We help them create the dashboard that you're seeing in the images.

475
00:38:10,194 --> 00:38:14,984  
And with them we're collaborating so for everyone it's easier to access the data.

476
00:38:14,984 --> 00:38:20,444  
And it's not only a tick box for donors or for the organization, but it's also an opportunity

477
00:38:20,444 --> 00:38:24,434  
to make better decisions based on the evidence that they are collecting

478
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:28,229  
Thank you.

479
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:31,849  
Thank you, Paula, for sharing

480
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:35,639  
the different types of services that our partner services team offers.

481
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:42,614  
And, also, just thank you for all the amazing work that you and your team have been doing.  Alright.

482
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,984  
Time for our last poll.

483
00:38:54,350 --> 00:39:00,610  
And this poll speaks the different scale at which

484
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:06,984  
the community uses the platform \- from small

485
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:12,604  
NGOs to large international NGOs,  running programs at scale.

486
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:22,359  
Give it another five seconds.

487
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:27,969  
Alright  Okay. We're over majority have voted.

488
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:34,454  
Let's end it, and here are the results. Alright.

489
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:38,514  
So five hundred to a thousand submissions

490
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:43,125  
is where most people are at.

491
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:49,830  
Alright. Thank you, everybody, for participating. And now we are

492
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:56,420  
moving to our Community Spotlight section, where we have Tala

493
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:02,834  
from WHH who'll be talking about

494
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:09,714  
her experience with our Teams offering, and then we'll have Sharon

495
00:40:09,714 --> 00:40:13,344  
talking about Save the

496
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:17,630  
Children's experience with our enterprise private server offering.

497
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:24,530  
So, we'll first start with Tala. So, Tala brings over eight years

498
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,360  
of monitoring and evaluation experience primarily in

499
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:33,465  
the Middle East and North Africa region.

500
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:40,294  
She has worked for a range of organizations, from NRC

501
00:40:40,294 --> 00:40:46,239  
to CESVI, and then right now at WHH.

502
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:52,469  
Tala specializes in designing MEAL systems and strengthening information

503
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:59,467  
management for evidence-based programming, and she also has experience across

504
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:04,357  
different programmatic areas, including shelter, livelihood, education,

505
00:41:04,357 --> 00:41:07,895  
protection, and nutrition with the recent

506
00:41:07,895 --> 00:41:12,337  
focus on the Palestine operations.

507
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:16,820  
Over to you, Tala. Tala: Thank you very much, Dev.

508
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,350  
Thank you for having me in this webinar. So, today, I'll be sharing our

509
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:25,919  
experience with using Kobo in the context of Gaza, which is an emergency context.

510
00:41:25,919 --> 00:41:32,865  
So, in the context of Gaza: Gaza, as you all know, has

511
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,265  
been facing one of the most severe humanitarian crises.

512
00:41:36,265 --> 00:41:42,205  
And over the past two years, the situation has deteriorated rapidly, with homes,

513
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:47,360  
hospitals, schools, infrastructures, severely damaged and destroyed.

514
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,550  
There's also been mass and ongoing displacements with over 90% of the population

515
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:58,974  
displaced and often multiple times. And the humanitarian situation has truly collapsed.

516
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:05,864  
And this has created a complex and high-risk operational environment.  And

517
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:11,560  
some of the operational challenges that we encounter.

518
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,850  
Could you move on to the next? Thank you.

519
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:18,680  
Some of the operational challenges that we encounter include access and movement

520
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,989  
restrictions, which truly limits our ability to reach people in need.

521
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:29,255  
The ongoing bombardments also pose a serious risk to our staff and the communities we serve.

522
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:34,735  
And the constant displacement is just another layer of complexity, making service

523
00:42:34,735 --> 00:42:40,540  
delivery unstable. The aid supplies are limited, which means that we must

524
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,899  
continuously verify and monitor and prioritize our services.

525
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:50,794  
And the population's needs are constantly evolving in this environment, and with that in

526
00:42:50,794 --> 00:42:57,734  
mind, our data systems need to be adaptive, timely, and transparent in order

527
00:42:57,734 --> 00:43:03,314  
to guide our response and uphold accountability and trust

528
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:09,770  
So,

529
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:16,580  
WHH truly works through local partners and our emergency response has focused mainly on

530
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:22,267  
three sectors, including nutrition and food, shelter, and

531
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:28,414  
NFI, and the WASH. Next, please.

532
00:43:28,414 --> 00:43:32,895  
And given the realities,

533
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:37,839  
that we're working with, Kobo has become essential to our response.

534
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:44,260  
It's enabled us to monitor activities remotely, especially when direct access is limited or unsafe.

535
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:50,945  
It's also given us timely and digitized data \- data that supports our decision making.

536
00:43:50,945 --> 00:43:54,554  
And Kobo works flexibly, and the fact that it's widely adopted by

537
00:43:54,554 --> 00:43:58,254  
our local partners facilitates our work.

538
00:43:58,254 --> 00:44:02,157  
And, specifically the Teams plan, has added the structure

539
00:44:02,157 --> 00:44:06,599  
And the scalability that we need to sustain our operations.

540
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,339  
So, with that, we've been able to tailor our

541
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:14,422  
data workflows to fit the realities on the ground.

542
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:20,474  
And this has been especially important for our verification and monitoring activities,

543
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:26,155  
where Kobo allows us to collect data even in hard to reach areas or when there's no Internet access.

544
00:44:26,155 --> 00:44:31,850  
Rapid needs assessment also helps us guide our emergency responses.

545
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:37,880  
And when it comes to expanding our network of local partners, Kobo has supported our

546
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:44,334  
preassessment process for CBOs. Because Kobo works offline and on

547
00:44:44,334 --> 00:44:49,034  
smartphones, it's accessible to our teams, our partners, even in the most

548
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:53,354  
challenging conditions. The Teams plan

549
00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:58,265  
has brought several key benefits that have strengthened our response.

550
00:44:58,265 --> 00:45:03,834  
The first is scalability. As our projects expand, we're able to scale our

551
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:08,532  
operations without needing to disrupt our existing workflow.

552
00:45:08,532 --> 00:45:14,734  
Second, it has decentralized project management,  which allows us to host all our

553
00:45:14,734 --> 00:45:22,002  
projects under one organizational account, and preserves the institutional knowledge within WHH.

554
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:27,792  
It also makes coordination between country offices and the field teams smoother and easier.

555
00:45:27,792 --> 00:45:33,542  
The third point is that the Teams management feature, which enables role

556
00:45:33,542 --> 00:45:39,392  
based access control, and allows us to align permissions with our staffing structure.

557
00:45:39,392 --> 00:45:43,752  
Because we have main coordinators, consultants, volunteers,

558
00:45:43,752 --> 00:45:48,130  
and data collectors, this fits perfectly with our structure.

559
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,350  
This not only promotes accountability, but it

560
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,199  
also safeguards sensitive data, especially in such conditions.

561
00:45:55,199 --> 00:46:00,059  
The last point is around having enhanced support from the Kobo team

562
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:03,785  
themselves.  And maybe,

563
00:46:03,785 --> 00:46:08,534  
lastly, from my side is just some feedback and reflections on the use of Kobo.

564
00:46:08,534 --> 00:46:15,004  
And feedback from the field has been generally very positive, and Kobo is seen as user-

565
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:19,360  
friendly, practical, and empowering to the local communities.

566
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:25,969  
Looking forward, WHH would want to capitalize on

567
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:30,820  
strengthening the team management to help us create a more structured and secure

568
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,919  
environment for data collection and promoting the library as a

569
00:46:34,919 --> 00:46:39,604  
centralized space for standardized templates and forms.

570
00:46:39,604 --> 00:46:43,695  
Thank you, and over to you, Dev. Dev: Thank you, Tala.

571
00:46:43,695 --> 00:46:48,574  
Thank you for taking the time to be here and for sharing

572
00:46:48,574 --> 00:46:52,395  
your experience about the

573
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:57,475  
platform and your ongoing work in Gaza.

574
00:46:57,475 --> 00:47:03,695  
Thank you so much. Now, we'll have Sharon

575
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:10,295  
share Save the Children’s experience with our Enterprise private server

576
00:47:10,295 --> 00:47:15,669  
offering. Sharon is a digital development professional.

577
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:22,499  
She leads efforts to expand and standardize data collection globally

578
00:47:22,499 --> 00:47:29,334  
within Save the Children. She has experience working across

579
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:36,145  
both local and international NGOs, along with experience in CSR and digital

580
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:43,040  
education initiatives  Sharon leverages technology to amplify impact.

581
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,660  
She holds an MSC in Development Management from London School of Economics.

582
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,882  
Over to you, Sharon. Welcome\!

583
00:47:51,882 --> 00:47:54,922  
Thank you, Dev. Hi, all. I'm Sharon Sagues.

584
00:47:54,922 --> 00:47:59,244  
I'm the associate product owner for digital data collection at Save the Children International,

585
00:47:59,244 --> 00:48:03,925  
and I'll be talking about our journey in using KoboToolbox as an organization wide strategic

586
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:08,119  
tool for data collection in our programs. As you may

587
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,479  
Save the Children works across the world, reaching millions of children every year.

588
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:18,060  
Whether it's responding to emergencies or improving education, data helps us to understand what

589
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,772  
works, where we need to improve, and how to increase impact.

590
00:48:22,772 --> 00:48:27,002  
So with thousands of staff and partners collecting data, we needed tools that are secure,

591
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:31,714  
scalable, and easy to use. Why?

592
00:48:31,714 --> 00:48:36,135  
Because accurate data capturing is essential in identifying activities that provide better

593
00:48:36,135 --> 00:48:40,294  
outcomes, allowing us to increase the impact towards our breakthroughs for the most

594
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:47,079  
marginalized and deprived children.

595
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:51,467  
Before KoboToolbox enterprise, our data collection faced three major issues.

596
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:57,824  
First, it was unsafe. Data was stored on laptops or in filing cabinets, and many tools used

597
00:48:57,824 --> 00:49:03,402  
didn't meet our data protection standards. Second, it was inefficient.

598
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:08,132  
MEAL teams spent hours manually processing data and building surveys from scratch with little

599
00:49:08,132 --> 00:49:13,550  
guidance on what tools to use. Third, we had low quality data.

600
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,840  
Too many tools meant data couldn't be easily shared or compared.

601
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,324  
Paper forms were still being used, and the lack of standardization made analysis difficult.

602
00:49:22,324 --> 00:49:27,365  
These challenges made it clear that we needed a secure, scalable, and standardized solution.

603
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:32,545  
So what did we do about it? In 2022, we launched our private enterprise, Kobo

604
00:49:32,545 --> 00:49:38,765  
Instance, exclusive to Save the Children offices; then, we started wide onboarding from 2023\.

605
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:45,302  
This gave us better control over data storage, access to new features, and improved data management for our users.

606
00:49:45,302 --> 00:49:50,764  
We supported the rollout with onboarding guidance, data migration from public Kobo instances,

607
00:49:50,764 --> 00:49:54,194  
a form library based on the public collections feature,

608
00:49:54,194 --> 00:49:58,237  
and ongoing help desk support for our users.

609
00:49:58,237 --> 00:50:02,547  
For some offices, this was not only transitioning from legacy digital tools, but a full

610
00:50:02,547 --> 00:50:05,737  
transition into digital data collection from paper.

611
00:50:05,737 --> 00:50:12,077  
The transition wasn't easy, but strong internal coordination and clear governance helped us overcome those hurdles.

612
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:17,775  
And within six months, over 95% of our offices were using our KoboToolbox instance.

613
00:50:17,775 --> 00:50:21,255  
Now, it's well embedded in our monitoring and evaluation, and

614
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:24,792  
we have millions of submissions annually to prove this.

615
00:50:24,792 --> 00:50:28,732  
But there's no better way to express this than through the words of our colleagues who have

616
00:50:28,732 --> 00:50:34,079  
highlighted, for example, an improvement in their security and data protection practices,

617
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,415  
effective time saving, and increased confidence through the usage of a standardized tool.

618
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:43,915  
We can hear from some of them in the video upcoming.

619
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,795  
Kobo is a magical and time saving platform.

620
00:50:52,795 --> 00:51:00,040  
Efficient. From our side would be data security and privacy.

621
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:04,070  
So, Kobo is real time, human friendly

622
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:16,495  
So, we are proud of the progress that we have made so far.

623
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:22,015  
And while the work is still far from over, we have learned some key lessons along the way.

624
00:51:22,015 --> 00:51:25,280  
On the “do” side, we managed to tap into a real

625
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,139  
demand for change from our country offices, which helped drive momentum.

626
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:33,790  
We also had senior stakeholder support, which was crucial because having champions at the top

627
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:40,224  
makes a real difference. We delivered clear and simple communications both globally and country

628
00:51:40,224 --> 00:51:46,274  
by country, and this helped keep everyone aligned. We prepared as much as possible, but we

629
00:51:46,274 --> 00:51:50,707  
stayed flexible to adapt to each country office's needs.

630
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:55,177  
Then, we scaled up existing features, for example, as I mentioned, to create shareable

631
00:51:55,177 --> 00:52:00,147  
templates working with our MEAL community to build an organization wide library of best in class

632
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:05,684  
forms for each of our thematic areas. On the “don't” side:

633
00:52:05,684 --> 00:52:11,894  
As a small team of three, our advice looking back is to not under-resource.

634
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:16,709  
Rolling out tech at scale needs dedicated people and time.

635
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:21,909  
We also recommend not to underestimate the role of local partners, which may vary widely, and

636
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:25,469  
we're still working on the best way to reach them all.

637
00:52:25,469 --> 00:52:31,327  
And for us, the migration task was also bigger than we expected, but it was essential for a smooth transition.

638
00:52:31,327 --> 00:52:35,844  
And finally, as you know, data aggregation across countries is complex.

639
00:52:35,844 --> 00:52:40,884  
Digitization through KoboToolbox and the creation of standardized forms are just the first

640
00:52:40,884 --> 00:52:44,464  
steps in building a truly comparable organization wide reporting system

641
00:52:44,464 --> 00:52:48,300  
So, that's it for me.

642
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:54,499  
Thank you for listening. Grateful to be part of this community, and here's to data that drives real change.

643
00:52:54,499 --> 00:53:00,675  
Thanks, Dev. Back to you. Dev: Thank you so much, Sharon.

644
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:05,255  
It was fascinating to hear Save the Children’s journey from using

645
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:11,025  
KoboToolbox so heavily in country offices in a decentralized way to

646
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:15,765  
now, how it's being deployed in such an organized fashion.

647
00:53:15,765 --> 00:53:19,309  
Thank you so much. Alright.

648
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:24,839  
So, now we will take some questions from our community.

649
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:31,795  
Thank you so much for all these questions. And, like I mentioned, we will do our

650
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:36,655  
best to answer as much as we can.

651
00:53:36,655 --> 00:53:42,864  
But if you're not able to get your question, we will be in touch

652
00:53:42,864 --> 00:53:49,350  
over email. Sharon, the first

653
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:56,020  
question is for you. There seems to be a lot of

654
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:02,834  
conversation in the community around how do organizations who adopt

655
00:54:02,834 --> 00:54:09,435  
a platform, say, KoboToolbox at a centralized level,

656
00:54:09,435 --> 00:54:16,250  
how do they manage to make it work

657
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:22,919  
financially from a perspective of are you billing back,

658
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:29,650  
the fees to individual users or country offices?

659
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:32,947  
Could you share a little bit about how

660
00:54:32,947 --> 00:54:37,415  
Save the Children manages? Sharon: Sure.

661
00:54:37,415 --> 00:54:41,385  
Yes. We do divide the the cost of the whole

662
00:54:41,385 --> 00:54:46,942  
Enterprise package among the country offices that are using this.

663
00:54:46,942 --> 00:54:51,412  
This is and we do it in an equal way for all the country offices.

664
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:56,882  
And, yeah, it's billed back, but it's a shared good, so we

665
00:54:56,882 --> 00:55:01,014  
we share the cost. Dev: Gotcha.

666
00:55:01,014 --> 00:55:04,435  
Thank you. The next

667
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:08,585  
question is for Tala.

668
00:55:08,585 --> 00:55:15,420  
Tala, you mentioned that a lot of your

669
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:21,710  
work happens through local implementing partners. Are there any

670
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:28,354  
certain specific lessons you want to share

671
00:55:28,354 --> 00:55:35,104  
when you work with local implementing partners where everybody is

672
00:55:35,104 --> 00:55:38,659  
using KoboToolbox?

673
00:55:38,659 --> 00:55:44,429  
Yeah. Thank you. That's a good question. Actually, we try to capitalize on what

674
00:55:44,429 --> 00:55:47,599  
partners have and try to improve the systems that they already have,

675
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,165  
just so we don't impose anything new on them.

676
00:55:51,165 --> 00:55:54,505  
In a way, that also makes their work easier,

677
00:55:54,505 --> 00:55:58,285  
and our work as well, easier.

678
00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:02,875  
So, the main lesson learned is really is just to work with what they have and improve the

679
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:07,655  
systems that they already have, whether that be developing the

680
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:12,835  
questionnaires or improving the questionnaires or the data flow and the linkages of

681
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:17,660  
the tools and forms within their Kobo.

682
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,455  
Thank you. Gotcha. Thank you.

683
00:56:21,455 --> 00:56:26,635  
Well, we have two minutes left. So, we'll take one more question.

684
00:56:26,635 --> 00:56:34,709  
Tino, this is for you. Does Kobo work with government agencies?

685
00:56:34,709 --> 00:56:40,869  
Let's say a government agency is running a project and they want their own

686
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:45,364  
KoboToolbox server.

687
00:56:45,364 --> 00:56:50,714  
Yeah\! Of course. I mean, the truth is many organizations and many government institutions already do that.

688
00:56:50,714 --> 00:56:56,675  
So, many of your cases, they collect data with Kobo and then at some point decide for

689
00:56:56,675 --> 00:57:01,824  
data sovereignty reasons or legal compliance reasons, they need the data to be on their own server.

690
00:57:01,824 --> 00:57:07,020  
And so we actually (I think Ayman mentioned this earlier) support

691
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:12,330  
235 different countries where the data can be hosted locally in our different data centers.

692
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:17,014  
So, if that's a necessity for, frankly, for large and

693
00:57:17,014 --> 00:57:21,844  
complex use cases, whether that's a government agency or organization, that's certainly possible.

694
00:57:21,844 --> 00:57:27,494  
And we support quite a few of those larger ministries or institutions that way.

695
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:40,000
