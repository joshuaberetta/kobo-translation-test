## Full Terminology

| English | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Background audio |  |
| Background audio recording |  |
| Choice box |  |
| Dashboard  (Data visualization dashboard) | For Spanish and French, “dashboard” is an acceptable alternative for more informal / less technical contexts, such as social media. |
| Data collection | In French, most instances should be translated to “collecte de données” (e.g., when referring to data collection in general / as a concept.) Exception: « collecte des données » can be used when referring to collecting specific data for a specific project (e.g., your data, these data). Use “la collecte de données” not “la collecte de données d'enquête”. Spanish: For “collect”, use “recolectar” , not “recopilar” |
| Disaggregate | French: not “ventiler” |
| Enumerator |  |
| Housing unit |  |
| Import (verb) |  |
| Insights |  |
| Invalid values |  |
| Manage (v) |  |
| Management (n) (data, project, user, team, case etc.) | For French, gestion and the verb gérer should be used. For Spanish, manejo and gestión are both acceptable translations for manage/management depending on the context. For data management and case management, manejo is the preferred translation. For managing teams and managing projects, gestión is preferred. |
| Mobile data collection / Collecting data on mobile devices |  |
| Record | “Submission” and “record” are equivalent terms (synonyms). The translation of these terms depends largely on context. Use the best translation to avoid confusion and achieve clarity, and apply that translation consistently in the specific context/ document. Translate both as “soumission” when content focuses specifically on survey records or entries in the context of data management, for example in the UI and Data table. Ex.: open, delete, and validate submissions -> ouvrir, supprimer, et valider des soumissions. Other cases when using “soumission” might be warranted include: Possible confusion with responses to individual questions or with the survey questionnaire  Modules or other content that focus specifically on data and submission management in the UI  When it is less important to identify submissions as a specific UI concept, use “réponse” or “formulaire” for submissions/responses to a survey. These are stylistically better in French for other contexts. Use these only when there is no possibility of confusion with responses to questions (for réponse) or with the survey questionnaire (for formulaire).  For example: “the enumerator uploads the submission” -> “l’enquêteur envoie le formulaire”  For example: “To modify one person’s submission” -> “pour modifier les réponses d’un individu” |
