# Question Types and Appearances

**📝 FORMATTING NOTE:**
- **Convert HTML heading tags to markdown:** `<h2>` → `##`, `<h3>` → `###`, etc.
- **Keep internal doc links as-is:** Relative links like `[text](article.md)` automatically resolve to the correct language folder
- **Update cross-language links:** Use directory paths like `../en/article.md`, `../es/article.md`, `../fr/article.md`
- Keep all other HTML tags intact (iframe, section, etc.)

## Question Appearances

**CRITICAL TRANSLATION APPROACH:**

Because appearance names must be used in English in XLSForm standard and Formbuilder:

- **Written content**: Include English followed by translation in parentheses
- **Video subtitles**: Use English only (character limits and video alignment)

**Example (French):** "Pour la question de type « Intervalle », vous pouvez choisir entre les options d'apparence vertical, picker (sélecteur), rating (notation) et distress (thermomètre)."
