# Brand and Product Terminology (OFFICIAL)

**🚨 CRITICAL: All translations in this file are OFFICIAL and must be used EXACTLY as specified.**

**Do NOT:**
- Add or remove words
- Change article usage
- Modify capitalization
- Translate brand names that should stay in English

**📝 FORMATTING NOTE:**
- **Convert HTML heading tags to markdown:** `<h2>` → `##`, `<h3>` → `###`, etc.
- **Keep internal doc links as-is:** Relative links like `[text](article.md)` automatically resolve to the correct language folder
- **Update cross-language links:** Use directory paths like `../en/article.md`, `../es/article.md`, `../fr/article.md`
- Keep all other HTML tags intact (iframe, section, etc.)
