# Course Content and Learning Platform Terms (PREFERRED)

These translations are preferred but can be adapted based on context and localization needs.

**📝 FORMATTING NOTE:**
- **Convert HTML heading tags to markdown:** `<h2>` → `##`, `<h3>` → `###`, etc.
- **Keep internal doc links as-is:** Relative links like `[text](article.md)` automatically resolve to the correct language folder
- **Update cross-language links:** Use directory paths like `../en/article.md`, `../es/article.md`, `../fr/article.md`
- Keep all other HTML tags intact (iframe, section, etc.)

## Localization Guidelines for Course Content

### Tone and Style
- Accessible and beginner-friendly
- Direct and factual
- Technical but clear for new users

### Proper Nouns
**For course content localization:**
- Translate proper nouns when possible
- Follow with English in parentheses on first instance and when needed for clarity
- Subsequent instances can use translation only

**For subtitles:**
- Use shortened versions due to character constraints

### Gender-Inclusive Language in Courses


**Note:** This approach should be explained in Course Navigation Guide for Spanish courses.
